# Counting-Duplicates
> Praise Olawuni - Summer 2021
>> A function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string.

# Additional Notes
* The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.
* E.g. "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
* "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
* "aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
* "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
